We can verify the IK Panel manually by:

1. Opening a browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000/
2. Logging in with username: 12345678901 and password: admin123
3. Clicking on "IK Paneli" in the navigation
4. Checking that the table includes a "Yönetici" column with the manager's name for each employee

Expected result: The IK Panel should display all active employees with their respective managers' names. The manager
field should be editable for Patron and Muhasebe users.

Alternatively, we can use the following curl command to fetch the IK Panel HTML and verify the manager information is
present:

curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8000/ik-paneli/ --cookie "csrftoken=lpOJiOAFBHBAds2hXovPO7YwJ0ntBkNO;
sessionid=1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
